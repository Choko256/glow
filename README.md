<h3>== HISTORY ==</h3>
<p>
Many years ago, a people, the Yarkis, live peacefully in their country. There was no crime, no murders, no violence.<br />
But another people live on an island near the Yarkis' country, the Harkans. They were organized in tribes who only want to conquer by the terror,
to get more power. During more than two thousand years, Yarki people has been protected by <i>the Glow</i>, a powerful artifact
which prevent all invaders from destroying the country.
</p>
<p>
Harkans tribes weren't lead by anyone, they wrote their own rules. Many tribes were in war, involving destructions inside the Harkan community.
<br />
A brave Harkan Warrior, Leovi'n, succeed to gather all tribes to order a massive attack on... the Glow itself. He knew
that, without the Glow, Yarki people would be vulnerable.
</p>
<p>
More than twenty thousand warriors have been taken by Levoi'n to find and destroy the Glow. After one month, they find a
huge and old cave, with magical vibrations and protection runes. Leovi'n, with all his anger, started to destroy the cave,
and succeed to find the so searched Glow.<br />
This was a little rock, emitting a blinding white light. The warrior leader approached the object, and with all the strength of his fury,
he stroke the Glow with his sword.
</p>
<p>
A huge explosion happenned. The cave had disappeared, Leovi'n and the Glow too. Troups who stayed outside the cave couldn't
believe their eyes. The mountain where the cave was digged has also disappeared. One of the soldiers approached and found a little
rock, which seemed to shine. This was a tiny fragment of the Glow.
<br />
Soldiers now knew how powerful was the Glow, and some of them thought it would be more interesting to retrieve it instead of
letting it destroyed and scattered.
</p>
<p>
From this time, Yarkis and Harkans had only one aim... Find all Glow fragments and piece them together again.
